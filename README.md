# testa.run

AI-powered QA and security testing that works.

Winner of the Security track at [HackEurope 2026](https://hackeurope2025.devpost.com/) — Europe's first multi-country in-person hackathon with 750+ participants across three cities (Dublin, Paris, Stockholm). We competed from Stockholm and won one of four tracks.

## About

testa.run is a SaaS platform that deploys AI agents to automatically explore and test websites. The agents navigate through your site testing for security vulnerabilities, API flaws, and database misconfigurations — then deliver actionable reports on everything they find.

You can watch the agents work in real time through an interactive dashboard, follow each step of their testing process, and drill into individual findings to understand and fix issues.

## What it has found

testa.run has uncovered critical vulnerabilities in nearly every website it has been pointed at, including:

- **HackEurope's own platform** — critical vulnerabilities that could compromise users
- **Lovable** — bad development practices that went past developers.
The platform is fully deployed and customer-ready at [testa.run](https://testa.run).
